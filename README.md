A demo script of this in action is shown below
```python
from pynotify import send_email, send_email_with_attachment

subject = "Killer Robot"
message = "Hi there!"
dest = "youremail@youremail.com" # add your email here

# attachment paths are stored in an array
image = ["cat.jpg"]
images = ["cat.jpg", "dog.jpg"]

# sends an email
send_email(dest, "Hello!")

# sends an email with attachements
send_email_with_attachment(dest, images, subject, message)

```
